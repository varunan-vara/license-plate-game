# License Plate Game
This is a website that I built to figure out possible answers to a game my family plays on Road Trips

### How it works: (Rules for license plates in Ontario (ABCD 012))
Avoiding the first letter, the goal is to make a word using the remaining letters. The three letters must appear in the same order in the word as they did in the plate, but other letters may be added before, in between, or after the main characters.
Ex. An answer to a plate like *CTR can be satisfaCToRy

The code was originally written in Python (game.py).
